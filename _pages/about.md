If describe me in one word, :thought_balloon: that would be Creatambitionate :wink: (**Creative, Ambitious and Passionate**). I am a total tech nerd. I simply love new tech and the field I am in now. Looking at the world with a technological eye, to see how can I help people using the knowledge I gain through past years as a graduate of **BSc.(Hons) Software Engineering** :mortar_board: from the University of Kelaniya.

So far the best part of my career was my one-year internship as a **Research Engineer** in Pearson Lanka Pvt. Ltd. I worked in different projects with different tech stacks while learning about complex architectural concerns along the way. My “thing” was Machine Learning and Deep Learning. But Pearson gave me the chance to grow as a full-stack dev as well. If I mention some of my tech stack (just for the formalities :wink: ):

* Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript
* Frameworks: SpringBoot, Flask, Django, ReactJs, VueJs
* Databases: MySQL, SqlServer, MongoDB
* DeepLearning: Vision & NLP, Tensorflow, Keras
* Cloud: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker
* Operating system: Linux, Windows
* Network&Deployment: Guicorn, Tomcat, Nginx, Ansible
* Tools: Git(BitBucket&Github), Colab, Postman


As I said, I work in this field because it is my passion. I love the people I meet in the industry, I love the conversations we make, the ideas people have, the different point of views they share about the same problem in hand. Simply I love the creativity of the industry I work in. I want to use my profession to help people in any way I can. I may be just one individual, but a group of like-minded people like us can do something better to this world, so let’s connect! :heart:
