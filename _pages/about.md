If describe me in one word, :thought_balloon: that would be Creatambitionate :wink: (**Creative, Ambitious and Passionate**). I am a total tech nerd. I simply love new tech and the field I am in now. Looking at the world with a technological eye, to see how can I help people using the knowledge I gain through past years as a **Research & Devlopment Software Engineer** and as a graduate of **BSc.(Hons) Software Engineering** :mortar_board: from the University of Kelaniya.

 I worked in different projects with different tech stacks while learning about complex architectural concerns along the way. My “thing” was solving problems. If I mention some of my tech stack (just for the formalities :wink: )
